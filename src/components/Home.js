          <h3>Who we are...</h3>
          <p>
            We are a small local chain of cafes specialising in simple,
            wholesome, locally sourced dishes.
          </p>
          <p>
            A homegrown business, we proved so popular we outgrew our original
            location and expanded to meet demand. Increased size means we can
            offer even better value across the Central belt.
          </p>
          <p>We take pride in providing straightforward, good value food.</p>
          <p>
            This branch was the first to open in 2016. Since then we have
            expanded to three other locations - all providing freshly cooked,
            locally sourced food. We aim to be as sustainable as possible.{" "}
          </p>
          <p>
            We are especially proud of our absolutely delicious traditional
            Italian dishes! Super fresh and indulgent.{" "}
          </p>
          <p>
            Not to mention our fabulous friendly staff - we look forward to
            welcoming you soon.
